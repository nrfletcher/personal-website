## Technologies used...

TypeScript
* Statically typed JavaScript just feels so much better.

Next.js w/ App Router
* App router is comfortable to use, and Next.js is fairly concise.

TailwindCSS
* Perfect balance of granularity in decision making, and ease of use.

Framer Motion
* Nice library for adding animations.

GitHub Pages + Actions
* Having hosting and CI/CD embedded into GitHub feels clean and simple.

AWS Route53 
* My default choice for cloud services, so I serve my domain here.

## Future improvements...

Rehaul blog page and add MDX support so writing new articles is considerably easier
* Add filters (this is less relevant since the number of articles is quite limited currently)

Add some sort of filtering/list of technologies for projects page
* This is also not a huge deal since there is only a small number of projects on there right now

Add better animations
* Currently animations are limited; add more (subtle) animations to general page transitions and link highlights, etc.
