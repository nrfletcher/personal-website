                    Hi, I&apos;m Riley, and I&apos;m currently studying computer science at the University of Virginia
                    and minoring in data science.
                    Besides taking classes, I&apos;m a teaching assistant for Computer Systems and Organization, 
                    and a student developer at theCourseForum. 
                    I love all things technology and computers,
                    however, I find particular interest in areas such as operating systems,
                    embedded systems, networks, security, and machine learning.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-xl">
                    Beyond computer stuff, I love to listen to music, read, and play a variety of sports. 
                    Lately, I&apos;ve been having fun mountain biking.
                    As much as I enjoy living in an IDE for hours, getting outside is crucial to me, and I love to explore new places. 
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-xl mb-4 font-semibold">My experience in technology.</p>

                    Currently, I am a software engineering intern at Dell Technologies working for the Powerstore team
                    on the backend protocols team. I&apos;m currently working on Python utilities for IO workload automation
                    and reporting, as well as IO tracing and analysis. This role has been super fun so far as I am very
                    interested in gaining more opportunities to work with systems software and hardware appliances.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-xl">
                I am a computer science teaching assistant at the University of Virginia where I instruct for
                Computer Systems and Organization I, an introductory systems course that teaches about hardware design,
                circuits, x86 assembly, and C programming. I primarily host office hours, labs, and assist in exam
                preperation. I&apos;ve really enjoyed this role, and it&apos;s taught me a lot about discussing problems
                and knowledge transferring. This Fall I&apos;m returning to CSO1 as well as CSO2, our secondary systems course 
                that focuses on C programming for systems concepts like concurrency, virtual memory, and Linux internals.

                    The Summer of 2023, after my final year at community college, I was a software engineering intern
                    for the United States Navy, at the Dahlgren research facility. As a part of the CIAT team,
                    I worked on naval training software where I spent most of my time improving the existing software by
                    addressing security concerns, outdated programming methodologies, and adding unit tests. I was able
                    to experience working on a large software project, and was introduced to things like CI/CD, agile
                    development, proper version control, and working in a lab with hardware appliances.
                </p>

                From the Summer of 2022 to Spring of 2023, I was an information technology intern at Virginia
                Railway Express. As my first &apos;proper&apos; technical role,
                I learned a lot about being in a professional environment. From a technical perspective, I did
                a lot of physical networking both in-office and at train stations, shell scripting to automate
                tasks and aggegrate data, and general help desk stuff. I ended up working here part time until the Summer
                of my second year at community college.
