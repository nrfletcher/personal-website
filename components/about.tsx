                <p className="sm:text-xl mb-4">
                    Hi, I&apos;m Riley, and I&apos;m currently studying computer science and data science at the University of Virginia, 
                    graduating Spring 2025. At UVA, I&apos;m a teaching assistant for Computer Systems and Organization I and II,
                    and a developer at theCourseForum. I&apos;ve been a software engineering intern at Dell Technologies, the United
                    States Navy, and worked as an information technology intern at Virginia Railway Express.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-xl mb-4"> 
                    I love all things to do with computing, but my main areas of interest are operating systems,
                    networks, security, embedded systems, and backend web development. The complexity of computer
                    systems fascinates me. I&apos;m always trying to build knowledge of the stack, from transistors
                    all the way to - how does JavaScript run in a browser?
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-xl">
                    When I&apos;m not indulging in tech, I love to read and write, listen to music, attempt to play guitar,
                    ride my mountainbike, and get outside exploring nature. Below, I expand the experience I&apos;ve
                    gained during my career.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-xl mb-4 font-semibold">My experience in technology.</p>

                <p className="sm:text-xl"> 
                    Currently, I am a software engineering intern at Dell Technologies working for the Powerstore team
                    on the backend protocols team. I&apos;m currently working on Python utilities for IO workload automation
                    and reporting, as well as IO tracing and analysis. This role has been super fun so far as I am very
                    interested in gaining more opportunities to work with systems software and hardware appliances.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-xl">
                I am a computer science teaching assistant at the University of Virginia where I instruct for
                Computer Systems and Organization I, an introductory systems course that teaches about hardware design,
                circuits, x86 assembly, and C programming. I primarily host office hours, labs, and assist in exam
                preperation. I&apos;ve really enjoyed this role, and it&apos;s taught me a lot about discussing problems
                and knowledge transferring. This Fall I&apos;m returning to CSO1 as well as CSO2, our secondary systems course 
                that focuses on C programming for systems concepts like concurrency, virtual memory, and Linux internals.

                <p className="sm:text-xl">
                    The Summer of 2023, after my final year at community college, I was a software engineering intern
                    for the United States Navy, at the Dahlgren research facility. As a part of the CIAT team,
                    I worked on naval training software where I spent most of my time improving the existing software by
                    addressing security concerns, outdated programming methodologies, and adding unit tests. I was able
                    to experience working on a large software project, and was introduced to things like CI/CD, agile
                    development, proper version control, and working in a lab with hardware appliances.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-xl">
                From the Summer of 2022 to Spring of 2023, I was an information technology intern at Virginia
                Railway Express. As my first &apos;proper&apos; technical role,
                I learned a lot about being in a professional environment. From a technical perspective, I did
                a lot of physical networking both in-office and at train stations, shell scripting to automate
                tasks and aggegrate data, and general help desk stuff. I ended up working here part time until the Summer
                of my second year at community college.

                <p className="sm:text-xl mb-4 font-semibold">Me personally, continued.</p>

                <p className="sm:text-xl">
                So, you&apos;re still curious to learn more about me?
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-xl">
                What do I read? Generally, I&apos;ll read just about anything if it interests me. A good author
                matters far more to me than the subject matter. That said, I love to learn about history, finance,
                philosophy, the natural sciences, and cars. When it comes to fiction, fantasy is my go to. Some of
                my favorites include The Hobbit, Percy Jackson, A Short History of Nearly Everything, and yes,
                I have to throw in a computer book (only because it is so good) - Code, by Charles Petzold.
                </p>

                <p className="sm:text-xl">What music do I listen to? I&apos;ve explored a lot of music and I have
                    a lot more yet to experience. Currently, I can&apos;t get enough
                    of The Smiths and Radiohead. If it&apos;s rock time, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Dire Straits, and
                    Jimi Hendrix take the cake. Some of my other all time favorites are Kendrick Lamar, Daft Punk,
                    deadmau5, and Joe Hisaishi.
